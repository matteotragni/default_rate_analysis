# default_rate_analysis
The aim of the analysis is to evaluate the default rates of the different industrial sectors as of mid-2023. It is interesting to see, after some data manipulation,
that the most affected sector was Real Estate: in my opinion, the main reason for this was the sharp increase in interest rates by the ECB, for which reason the interests on
floating-rate loans skyrocketed.
